######################################
# The following scripts instanciates the final network of our assignment
# for the course Bayesian Networks.
# A picture of the network and it's nodes can be found in the report.
#
# The fitted network has the name "fittedbn".
#
# After running the script, you will be able to run queries on the 
# bayesian network. The following are just a few examples on how to
# do it:
# 
# The query would have the following structure:
#
# result <- cpquery(fittedbn, event = (Weapon=="VALUE"), evidence = (AVAILABLE_DATA))
# Where "VALUE" should be "2" to predict the probability of a teenager carring
# a weapon to school and AVAILABLE_DATA should be a list of all the information
# available we have about the teenager we are testing the network against.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# result <- cpquery(fittedbn, event = (Weapon=="2"), evidence = (Sex=="1"))
# Probability of carrying a weapon by a female teenager.
# result = 0.0191
#
# result <- cpquery(fittedbn, event = (Weapon=="2"), evidence = (Sex=="1" & Unsecure=="2"))
# Probability of carrying a weapon by an unsecure female teenager
# result = 0.084


# 
# Load the data.
# Remember to keep this script in the same directory as the data (ProjectData.csv)
#
