Inference Problem

	Main goal of our Bayesian Network is trying to predict how likely is for given individual to carry some kind of weapon in school. 
    That prediction is based on individual's basic info (age, sex, race, grades) and some other important factors like how often does
	that individual get drunk, is he/she depressed etc.

	Furthermore, we want to see what variables make greatest impact on carrying weapon to schools.
	Last but not least, we want to see if there are more bullied individuals in schools where students are more likely to carry a weapon.

Implementation Problem

We will implement our Bayesian Network using Python's pgmpy library.

Problem Domain

	Violence in schools represent a serious problem in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved.
 Although school is meant to be a secure and friendly place for every person, a place to meet new people and learn interesting stuff, 
many children are afraid to go there. They are often threatened and bullied by other children. That kind of environment is unacceptable
 and something has to be done in order to prevent further violence. Bullied children can have serious consequences for the rest of their lives.

Lots of different factors can contribute school violence. For example home environment can be major factor. The Constitutional Rights 
Foundation suggests long-term exposure to gun violence, parental alcoholism, domestic violence, physical abuse of the child, and child 
sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.

In this project we are focusing on some of the individual's characteristics in order to predict their behaviour, how are those 
characteristics connected and how important are they.
